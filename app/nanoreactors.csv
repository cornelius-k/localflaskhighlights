Though simulations have suggested that the surface roughness of their water-filled nanochannels significantly influence ion transport, the uncertain morphologies of these membranes have made it difficult to determine how the curvature of their pores influences water and ion motion. To investigate this question, Santanu Roy, James Skinner, and colleagues have used experiments and simulations to compare water motion in membranes with nanopores that have mostly convex or concave interfaces with water. Their results show that the convex surfaces have significantly less “curvature-induced frustration” than the concave surfaces, and thus move water and ions faster. The authors suggest that these findings could help guide the future design of artificial membranes that rapidly transport protons and other ions."

That is the case for green fluorescent protein (GFP), well known for its use as a gene expression reporter. The emission of GFP’s 4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone fluorophore is largely controlled through interactions with a surrounding b-barrel protein. Natalia Shustova and colleagues have created a system to study GFP fluorescence by synthesizing a metal‒organic framework (MOF) as a mimic of the protein b-barrel. The researchers find that the maximum emission of their artificial framework is similar to the natural one and that the emission can be tuned by modifying the MOF. This work could lead to the design of new tunable fluorescent protein mimics."

Significantly less is known about a second strategy, in which an analyte, such as a protein, changes the nanochannel conductance by binding to specific ligands on the inner walls. In their study, Mario Tagliazucchi and Igal Szleifer explore factors at play in this second strategy. They find that using ligand molecules of the right length enables sensing of proteins that are much smaller than the radius of the channels. Moreover, the response of the sensor can be improved when the proteins and ligands have opposite charge. These results are fundamentally interesting, and they could guide the design and development of novel chemical sensors based on this second strategy."

This proton channel is embedded within lipid bilayers in protic solutions. Electrical recordings show that protons move more rapidly in one direction through the channel than the other. The researchers attribute these results to the orientations of water molecules inside the proton-conducting channels. These findings could inform the design of targeted cytotoxic drugs or proton conductors in fuel cells."

The ability to identify the presence and position of these mistakes in DNA sequences will help researchers better understand how these errors occur, what effect they have on genomic fidelity, and how they are recognized and repaired. In a recent study, a team led by Cynthia Burrows and Henry White details a new method that uses the natural protein pore a-hemolysin to identify and differentiate DNA containing the mismatched base pairs CC and CA. Hemolysin forms a channel with a constricted “latch” at the top. The researchers show that as the mismatched base pairs pass through the latch, they cause a change in current recorded from this protein that is unique for each type of mismatch. The authors attribute the unique signals to the different mismatched bases jutting out from the DNA double strand and suggest that this technique could be expanded to identify signatures of other mismatch types."

Florika Macazo and Ryan White demonstrate this capability by uniting the biological nanopore a-hemolysin and scanning ion conductance microscopy to yield a technique that gives information about surface topography. By integrating a protein channel into a lipid bilayer on a microscope probe tip, the researchers are able to simultaneously gather information about the presence of b-cyclodextrin molecules on a substrate and their subsequent migration into the probe. The authors suggest that this blended tool could provide combined spatial, chemical, and mechanistic information on molecular transport processes."

Bin Ren and colleagues detail a new technique known as electrochemical TERS (EC-TERS) that can produce clear chemical information of adsorbates under changing potentials using a modified scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A key to EC-TERS is introducing light at a 10° angle, which minimizes optical distortion in the small stage of a STM. Understanding of nanoscale confined reactions in electrochemical systems including solar cells, lithium ion batteries, and fuel cells could be improved through applications of this new technique."

Using the redox species Ru(NH3)62+/3+, the researchers show that at low analyte concentrations and without the supporting electrolyte, ions accumulate in the array’s nanopores, leading to significantly increased current amplification compared to redox cycling with the supporting electrolyte present. Ion enrichment and ion migration effects act in synergy with redox cycling in this system, leading to a total current amplification up to 2000-fold compared to a single microelectrode array of the same area. The authors note that this phenomenon makes these unusual arrays a useful tool for electrochemical processing and analysis."

Combining density functional theory with previously reported experimental results for several CNT-encapsulated transition metal catalysts, they find that the nanospace and π electrons—highly mobile electrons present in the curved graphene sheets that make up nanotubes—affect the dissociative binding energy of several probe molecules. It is decreased on the encapsulated particles with respect to those outside of the nanotube. For encapsulated iron, the weakened binding results in an increased catalytic activity in carbon monoxide hydrogenation, while for ruthenium the confinement results in the opposite effect in carbon monoxide hydrogenation and ammonia decomposition. Nanotubes and the confinement effects may be used to modulate important catalytic processes."

The team forms nanocrystal colloidosomes, hollow balls of nanocrystals, and then uses these as nanoreactors in which to grow other nanocrystals. These colloidal assemblies could have applications in biomedicine, for example as drug delivery agents, imaging tools, hyperthermia therapeutics, and more."

Though interactions between different molecules such as proteins can be successfully predicted using computer simulations, there are few accurate models to investigate the influence of spatial constraints on binding and activity. In their study, Cornelia Palivan, Wolfgang Meier, and colleagues detail a new way to simultaneously investigate both molecular recognition and spatial constraints using a library of polymers. Each polymer has multiple sites that bind to histidine tags, spaced apart at various distances. This system reveals that small molecular mass molecules can bind to sites on any of the polymers, yet large molecules such as proteins only bind to polymers where the average distance between histidine tag binding sites is larger than the proteins themselves. This system could eventually be used to organize proteins or other molecules for combination therapies."
