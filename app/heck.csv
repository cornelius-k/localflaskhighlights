10.1021/om401126m,The Challenge of Palladium-Catalyzed Aromatic Azidocarbonylation: From Mechanistic and Catalyst Deactivation Studies to a Highly Efficient Process,"Fedor M. Miloserdov, Claire L. McMullin, Marta Martínez Belmonte, Jordi Benet-Buchholz, Vladimir I. Bakhmutov, Stuart A. Macgregor*, Vladimir V. Grushin*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/om401126m.jpeg,Organometallics,2014,33,3,736-752,"The palladium-catalyzed Heck carbonylation reaction is among the most practiced methods to prepare aromatic carbonyl compounds from aryl halides. Macgregor, Grushin, and their colleagues have developed a novel Heck-type azidocarbonylation for direct access to aroyl azides that can readily be isolated or converted in situ into isocyanates, ureas, and benzamides, among others. This transformation is catalyzed by Xantphos-Pd and proceeds in a water–organic solvent biphasic system under ambient conditions to afford aroyl azides on the gram scale. The authors have conducted comprehensive experimental and computational studies to reveal detailed and widely applicable mechanistic information and to solve problems such as catalyst deactivation."
10.1021/om401240p,Mechanistic Investigations of Palladium-Catalyzed Allylic Fluorination,"Matthew H. Katcher, Per-Ola Norrby, Abigail G. Doyle*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/om401240p.jpeg,Organometallics,2014,33,9,2121-2133,"The formation of C−F bonds is a major strategy to prepare organofluorine compounds, and while a number of catalytic fluorination reactions have been developed, it was only recently that the first examples of transition-metal-catalyzed allylic fluorination, a transformation previously thought impossible, were reported. Following their initial success, Doyle and co-workers have conducted a detailed mechanistic study of the Pd(0)-catalyzed fluorination of allylic chlorides using AgF. They propose a homobimetallic mechanism involving a neutral nucleophile attacking a cationic electrophile, both derived from a key intermediate allylpalladium fluoride, which may provide insights into the mechanism of other catalytic fluorination reactions."
10.1021/ol500326g,Access to cinnamyl derivatives from arenes and allyl esters by a biomimetic aerobic oxidative dehydrogenative coupling,"Nicolas Gigant, Jan-E. Bäckvall*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ol500326g.jpeg,Org. Lett.,2014,16,6,1664-1667,"The intermolecular coupling of arenes and alkenes, often referred to as the dehydrogenative Heck reaction, has attracted significant attention as a synthetically efficient method to form C–C bonds. These processes, however, usually rely on superstoichiometric, environmentally unfriendly oxidants. Gigant and Bäckvall employ ambient pressure dioxygen as the oxidant by using catalytic electron-transfer mediators 1,4-benzoquinone and iron phthalocyanine to facilitate the reoxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II) in this dehydrogenative Heck process. The reaction conditions are mild and suitable for late-stage Heck arylation strategies. Importantly, this biomimetic aerobic oxidation system will likely be applicable to other catalysts."
10.1021/ol500778u,Pd-catalyzed autotandem C-C/C-C bond-forming reactions with tosylhydrazones: synthesis of spirocycles with extended π-conjugation,"Raquel Barroso, Rocío A. Valencia, María-Paz Cabal, Carlos Valdés*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ol500778u.jpeg,Org. Lett.,2014,16,8,2264-2267,"One of the frontiers of modern catalysis is the development of cascade processes, and those that incorporate the Heck reaction have seen increased interest. Valdés and co-workers exploit a cross-coupling/Heck reaction strategy to access spirocycles with extended π-conjugation. Deprotonation of cyclic tosylhydrazones with LiOtBu in the presence of polyaryl dibromides and a palladium catalyst results in a diazo compound that undergoes cross-coupling to generate an olefin. An intramolecular Heck reaction occurs with ring closure to afford a variety of spirocyclic compounds with potential applications in optoelectronics."
10.1021/ja5029556,Arylboration of Alkenes by Cooperative Palladium/Copper Catalysis,"Kazuhiko Semba*, Yoshiaki Nakao*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ja5029556.jpeg,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,2014,136,39,7567-7570,"Using two distinct metal-catalyzed processes in a single operation can facilitate both unique reactivity and access to useful building blocks. Semba and Nakao report a particularly exciting example wherein the combination of copper and palladium catalysis promotes arylboration of alkenes. The process is thought to be initiated by migratory insertion of an alkene into a copper–boron bond of borylcopper species, akin to migratory insertion of an alkene into a palladium–carbon bond of arylpalladium species in the Heck reaction, followed by cross-coupling with an arylpalladium species formed through oxidative addition of an aryl halide. The process is highly regioselective and forms widely used alkyl BPin reagents."
10.1021/ja5026485,Enantiospecific Intramolecular Heck Reactions of Secondary Benzylic Ethers,"Michael R. Harris, Mikhail O. Konev, Elizabeth R. Jarvo*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ja5026485.jpeg,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,2015,137,15,7825-7828,"The classic Heck reaction engages either aryl or alkenyl halide coupling partners, with recent examples including primary alkyl electrophiles as coupling partners. In this report by Jarvo and co-workers, the authors show that a secondary benzylic ether linked to alkene under nickel catalysis can cyclize via a Heck-type mechanism. Of particular interest is the enantiospecificity of the reactions, consistent with a mechanism that does not proceed through radical intermediates."
10.1021/ja5082734,"Palladium-Catalyzed Aryl C–H Olefination with Unactivated, Aliphatic Alkenes","Arghya Deb, Sukdev Bag, Rajesh Kancherla, Debabrata Maiti*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ja5082734.jpeg,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,2014,136,39,13602-13605,"A significant limitation to the Heck reaction has been the dependence on conjugated alkenes in order to avoid the isomerization often observed when simple terminal alkenes are used. Maiti and co-workers have overcome this constraint and report a directed palladium-catalyzed C‒H olefination using a wide range of terminal alkenes. Of particular note, only single olefin isomer products are isolated from reactions with straight-chain aliphatic olefins."
10.1021/jo501813d,Investigating the Nature of Palladium Chain-Walking in the Enantioselective Redox-Relay Heck Reaction of Alkenyl Alcohols,"Margaret J. Hilton, Li-Ping Xu, Per-Ola Norrby, Yun-Dong Wu, Olaf Wiest, Matthew S. Sigman*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/jo501813d.jpeg,J. Org. Chem.,2014,79,24,11841-11850,"Alkenols of various types have been shown to undergo intermolecular enantioselective Heck arylations wherein the palladium catalyst migrates to the alcohol through iterative migratory insertion and β-hydride elimination steps in a so-called “chain-walking” process. The reaction is terminated by formation of a carbonyl. In this report, mechanistic studies of the reaction are performed using computational and experimental investigations. Through extensive isotopic labeling studies, Sigman and co-workers conclude that the chain-walking is primarily in the direction of the alcohol and that the catalyst remains ligated to the same face of the alkene throughout the migration."
10.1021/ol5023933,Solvent-Controlled Switchable C−H Alkenylation of 4‑Aryl‑1<i>H</i>‑pyrrole-3-carboxylates: Application to the Total Synthesis of (±)-Rhazinilam,"Youla Su, Haipin Zhou, Jiaxuan Chen, Jinyi Xu, Xiaoming Wu, Aijun Lin*, Hequan Yao*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ol5023933.jpeg,Org. Lett.,2014,16,18,4884-4887,"Direct C–H alkenylation reactions, often called the oxidative Heck reaction or Fujiwara–Moritani reaction, are powerful tools for generation of C–C bonds. Lin, Yao, and their team have demonstrated a regioselective C–H alkenylation of 4-aryl-1<i>H</i>-pyrrole-3-carboxylates using a Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> catalyst. Interestingly, the regioselectivity of the C–H alkenylation is controlled simply by switching solvents. In weakly coordinating solvents, the reaction proceeds by substrate-directed C–H functionalization, whereas strongly coordinating solvents override the internal coordination and result in activation at the 5-position. Application of the method to the synthesis of (±)-rhazinilam is reported."

Org. Chem.,2014,79,22,10734-10742,"The formation of palladium intermediates that can be captured through Heck-type reactions is a common and useful strategy in the building of molecular complexity. In the report by Wu, Jiang, and co-workers, an unusual coupling of alkynoic acids or alkynols with styrenes is presented. The reaction is thought to be initiated through Wacker addition of chloride to the alkyne, which forms a vinyl–palladium species. This intermediate is arrested through a Heck insertion of styrene derivatives followed by cyclization with a pendant nucleophile derived from the alkyne substrate."
10.1021/ol502953w,General and Facile Method for exo-Methlyene Synthesis via Regioselective C−C Double-Bond Formation Using a Copper−Amine Catalyst System,"Takashi Nishikata*, Kimiaki Nakamura, Kohei Itonaga, Shingo Ishikawa",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ol502953w.jpeg,Org. Lett.,2014,16,21,5816-5819,One of the remaining challenges in the Heck reaction is control of regioselectivity in the formation of the C–C double bond with unbiased olefins because of difficulties in steering the β-hydride elimination and palladium-catalyzed double-bond isomerization. Nishikata and co-workers have taken an alternative approach involving copper-catalyzed atom-transfer radical addition using α-halocarbonyl compounds. The generated intermediates undergo base-promoted elimination to produce Heck-type products containing terminal olefins with good regioselectivities.

Scott Bohle, Chao-Jun Li*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ol502955r.jpeg,Org. Lett.,2014,16,24,6282-6285,"The biological activity of alkene-containing natural products and synthetic compounds is often dependent on the <i>E/Z</i> configuration. Controlling double-bond geometry in the Heck reaction is therefore important but can be challenging. Li and co-workers report a decarboxylative Heck arylation of cinnamaldehydes that enables access to <i>E</i>- or <i>Z</i>-isomers with good to excellent selectivity by switching solvents. The authors hypothesize that in DMF the insertion product undergoes direct β-hydride elimination, whereas in THF the palladium can isomerize between the C- and O-bound enolates, thereby accessing the thermodynamic product. Although the scope of the reaction is narrow, this work represents an important step in controlling β-hydride elimination in the Heck reaction."
10.1021/ja5104525,Endo-Selective Pd-Catalyzed Silyl Methyl Heck Reaction,"Marvin Parasram, Viktor O. Iaroshenko, Vladimir Gevorgyan*",/pb-assets/images/selects/heck-legacy/ja5104525.jpeg,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,2014,136,5,17926-17929,"In an “alkyl” Heck reaction with broad substrate scope, Gevorgyan and co-workers illustrate that an iodomethylsilane linked to an alkene can undergo cyclization using palladium catalysis. Interestingly, radical trap studies suggest that the process is likely a hybrid palladium-catalyzed formation of a silylmethyl radical followed by radical cyclization. The resultant radical is then trapped with palladium, which promotes β-hydride elimination to form the observed Heck-type products."

Org. Chem.,2015,80,4,2407-2412,"The use of alternative coupling partners to replace aryl halides has become an attractive strategy to expand the utility of Heck reactions. Of particular interest is the direct use of C‒H bonds. In this example by Pan, Chen, and their co-workers, the authors show that Heck products can be formed not only by using C‒H bonds but also by substituting the alkene for an alkenoic acid, which produces an organometallic intermediate through in situ decarboxylation. Cross-coupling of this organometallic species and an arene leads to Heck-type products."

Braga, Navarro, and co-workers synthesize an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-palladate ionic complex as an efficient and selective precatalyst for Heck cross-coupling. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest an Amatore−Jutand-type mechanism, a modified catalytic cycle where the in situ formed anionic [(NHC)-Pd(0)-Cl]<sup>−</sup> species plays a key role in a combination of neutral and anionic steps."

Org. Chem.,2015,80,9,4223-4234,"In aromatic C−H activation reactions, directing groups are widely used to increase regioselectivity, but they may limit the scope of the desired transformation, as they can be unwanted in target molecules. Schmidt and co-workers explore the multifaceted reactivity of the acetamide group as a dual-purpose auxiliary, serving first as a directing group for the Pd(II)-catalyzed regioselective oxidative <i>ortho</i>-C−H activation and then as a diazonium-convertible quasi-leaving group for the subsequent Heck-type or other Pd(0)-catalyzed functionalization.

However, many of the reported examples initiated by Heck-type reactions have not been enantioselective. The Toste group has overcome this limitation, and they report a palladium-catalyzed, enantioselective 1,1-arylborylation of a terminal alkene using a chiral phosphate anion. The success of this reaction is likely due to the use of an insoluble aryldiazonium salt that participates in the reaction by phase transfer with the chiral phosphate anion."
